ATM Machine program using Java

In this example, the ATM machine has a fixed initial account balance of 1000.0 and a fixed PIN of 1234. The user is prompted to enter their PIN, and if it matches the fixed PIN, they are presented with a menu of options:

Check balance: Displays the current account balance.

Withdraw: Prompts the user for an amount to withdraw and subtracts it from the account balance if it is less than or equal to the current balance.

Deposit: Prompts the user for an amount to deposit and adds it to the account balance.

Exit: Terminates the ATM program.

If the user enters an invalid PIN, they are notified and the program terminates. If the user enters an invalid menu choice, they are notified and presented with the menu again.
